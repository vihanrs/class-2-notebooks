## Assignment 8: Micro-Coach (On-Demand Streaming)

Create a tiny coaching assistant that can stream motivational guidance when
requested, or return a compact non-streamed plan otherwise.

### Concepts practiced
- Streaming with callbacks
- `with_config` to toggle callbacks at runtime

### Your task
- Implement `micro_coach_streamer.py` per the docstrings. Keep the interface
  simple and rely on runtime flags.

### Run
```
python micro_coach_streamer.py
```
