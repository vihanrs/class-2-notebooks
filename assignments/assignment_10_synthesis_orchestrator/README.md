## Assignment 10: Synthesis Orchestrator (Two-Stage Pipeline)

Combine short notes from different sources into a single, coherent synthesis.
First extract key claims from each note in parallel, then produce a unified
summary that highlights agreements and conflicts.

### Concepts practiced
- Two-stage LCEL pipelines
- `.batch()` followed by a single aggregation call

### Your task
- Follow the docstrings in `synthesis_orchestrator.py` to implement an extractor
  chain and a synthesizer chain, wiring them into one flow.

### Run
```
python synthesis_orchestrator.py
```
