## Assignment 9: Puzzle Hint Engine (Difficulty Controls)

Design an assistant that generates layered hints for a logic puzzle based on
player attempts and a chosen difficulty.

### Concepts practiced
- Structured outputs (Pydantic) or JSON parsing
- Difficulty-driven runtime config (e.g., temperature via `.bind`)

### Your task
- Implement according to `puzzle_hint_engine.py` docstrings. Keep outputs tidy
  and avoid spoilers at lower difficulties.

### Run
```
python puzzle_hint_engine.py
```
