    "In this notebook we’ll learn how to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) directly using the **OpenAI Python SDK**.  \n",
    "This is the **first time** we’re exploring API interactions, so we’ll build up gradually:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize** the client with your API key.  \n",
    "2. **Minimal call** to the API (Responses API).  \n",
    "3. Use **Chat Completions** for system + user roles.  \n",
    "4. Explore **temperature** (randomness) and **top_p** (nucleus sampling).  \n",
    "5. Add **system prompts** to guide behavior.  \n",
    "6. Try **streaming tokens** (like ChatGPT typing).  \n",
    "7. Get **JSON/structured outputs** with schemas.  \n",
    "8. Handle **errors, timeouts, and retries** gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you’ll know how to **call an LLM safely and flexibly** using just the OpenAI SDK."

      "Once upon a time in a sun-drenched little village, there lived a cat named Whiskers and a dog named Barkley. They resided in neighboring houses, separated by a low wooden fence that, for years, had kept them apart. Whiskers was a sleek, gray tabby with a penchant for climbing trees and basking in the sunlight, while Barkley was a jovial golden retriever with boundless energy and a love for chasing after anything that moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two animals had seen each other from a distance but had never exchanged a word. Whiskers would often watch Barkley romp through the yard, chasing butterflies and wagging his tail, while Barkley admired Whiskers perched on a branch, her eyes gleaming in the afternoon sun. Despite their differences, a spark of curiosity flickered between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "One fateful afternoon, a powerful storm swept through the village, bringing with it heavy rain and howling winds. Whiskers, frightened and seeking shelter, climbed down from her tree and darted toward the safety of her home. But as she scurried past the fence, she heard a frantic barking. It was Barkley, trying to squeeze his way through a gap in the fence, barking wildly as he searched for a place to escape the storm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey! You’ll get stuck!” Whiskers called out, her heart racing with concern. \n",
      "\n",
      "Barkley paused, his wet fur glistening like gold in the dim light. “I just want to get to safety! Do you know anywhere we can hide?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whiskers thought for a moment. “Follow me!” she said, leading him around the house to the back porch, where a small shed stood. It was old and filled with gardening tools, but it was dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together, they squeezed into the shed just as the storm reached its peak. The wind howled, and rain pelted the roof, but inside the shed, they found a moment of calm. As they huddled together, Barkley looked at Whiskers with wide, grateful eyes. “Thank you for helping me. I’ve always wanted to meet you, but I didn’t know how.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whiskers purred softly, feeling warmth spread through her. “I’ve watched you from afar. You seem like a lot of fun.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the storm raged outside, they shared stories about their lives. Whiskers told Barkley about her adventures climbing the tallest trees, while Barkley regaled Whiskers with tales of his escapades chasing squirrels and playing fetch. They laughed and shared secrets, and soon the storm didn’t seem so frightening anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the skies finally cleared and the sun peeked out, they emerged from the shed, both soggy but smiling. The world looked different now, transformed by the storm. Barkley wagged his tail, splattering mud everywhere, while Whiskers shook off the rain, her fur fluffing up like a cloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wanna race to the tree?” Barkley challenged, his eyes sparkling with excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whiskers, feeling playful, accepted. “You’re on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With a burst of energy, they dashed across the yard, the barriers of the past forgotten. They raced, barked, and purred with joy, their laughter echoing through the village. From that day on, Whiskers and Barkley were inseparable, exploring the world together, each adventure building a bond that neither of them had ever expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, a cat and a dog became the best of friends, proving that sometimes a storm can lead to the brightest of friendships.\n"
