Use **Chat Completions** for system + user roles.  \n4. Explore **temperature** (randomness) and **top_p** (nucleus sampling).  \n5. Add **system prompts** to guide behavior.  \n6. Try **streaming tokens** (like ChatGPT typing).  \n7. Get **JSON/structured outputs** with schemas.  \n8. Handle **errors, timeouts, and retries** gracefully.\n\nBy the end, you'll know how to **call an LLM safely and flexibly** using just the OpenAI SDK.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Client Initialization\n\nSet up the OpenAI client with your API key. This is your primary gateway to interact with OpenAI's models through their Python SDK."

      "Once upon a time in a cozy little town, there lived a adventurous tabby cat named Whiskers and a gentle golden retriever named Buddy. They lived in neighboring houses, separated only by a white picket fence. Though they were different in many ways, they shared one common trait: an insatiable curiosity about the world around them.\n",
      "\n",
      "One sunny afternoon, as the warm breeze rustled the leaves, Whiskers perched on the fence, gazing at the vast expanse of the backyard. “Hey, Buddy!” she called, her green eyes sparkling with excitement. “Let’s go on an adventure!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Buddy looked up from his shady spot under the old oak tree. His tail wagged enthusiastically. “Where to?” he asked, his voice a deep rumble of joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let’s explore the enchanted forest beyond the park!” Whiskers suggested, her whiskers twitching with anticipation. The forest was known for its shimmering streams and tall, whispering trees, but it also contained tales of hidden treasures and magical creatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a bark of agreement, Buddy bounded over to the fence, and together they slipped through a gap, ready for whatever awaited them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they entered the forest, the sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the ground. Whiskers hopped gracefully from stone to stone, while Buddy trotted beside her, his nose sniffing the air for the scent of adventure. They laughed and played, chasing butterflies and exploring nooks and crannies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, they stumbled upon a sparkling stream. The water glistened like diamonds, and on the other side, they saw an old, gnarled tree with a door carved into its trunk. “Do you think anyone lives there?” Buddy whispered, his voice full of wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only one way to find out!” Whiskers replied, her eyes gleaming with mischief. With a swift leap, she crossed the stream on a fallen log. Buddy hesitated, looking at the rushing water, then determinedly followed after her, splashing through the shallow parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they reached the tree, Whiskers gently nudged the door with her paw. To their surprise, it creaked open, revealing a small room filled with twinkling lights and shelves of colorful jars. In the center stood a wise old owl, perched atop a pile of books.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Welcome, young adventurers,” the owl hooted, adjusting his tiny spectacles. “I see you’ve come seeking magic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whiskers’ eyes widened. “We want to find treasure and see magical creatures!” she exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The owl chuckled softly. “The greatest treasure lies not in gold or jewels, but in friendship and the adventures you share. But if you truly seek magic, you must prove your bond.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Intrigued, Buddy and Whiskers nodded eagerly. The owl set forth a series of challenges: they had to work together to solve riddles, navigate a maze of tall grasses, and even help a lost firefly find its way home.\n",
      "\n",
      "With each challenge, they learned more about each other’s strengths. Whiskers’ agility and cleverness complemented Buddy’s strength and loyalty. Together, they overcame every obstacle, their laughter echoing in the woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, they returned to the wise owl, who smiled warmly at them. “You have proven your friendship, and for that, I grant you a gift.” He waved his wing, and a soft, golden light enveloped them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the light faded, Whiskers and Buddy found themselves back at the fence, the sun setting behind them. In their paws were two shimmering tokens—one a small bell, the other a golden bone. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Every time you use these, remember the magic of your friendship and the adventures you can have together,” the owl’s voice echoed in their hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that day on, Whiskers and Buddy embarked on countless adventures, exploring the world around them, always together. They discovered that the true magic lay not in treasures or magical creatures, but in the bond they shared—a friendship that turned every day into an extraordinary adventure.\n"
